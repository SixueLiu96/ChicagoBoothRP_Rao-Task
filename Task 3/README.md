This folder contains two files:
- Data Task3.ipynb (The original results in jupyter notebook version for Task 1)
- Data Task3.pdf (PDF version of the results)

For the task3, I provide detailed results for the first question. For the second question, I do have a few questions in order to do further analysis:
 1. 'How far apart are the transactions?' I wonder does this mean the transactions with the same machine_id, or the related transactions? 
 2. I am really confused about the defination of 'related transactions'
