This folder contains two files:
- Data Task3.ipynb (The original results in jupyter notebook version for Task 1)
- Data Task3.pdf (PDF version of the results)

For the task3, I provide detailed results for the first question. For the second question, I do have a few questions in order to do further analysis:
 1. 'How far apart are the transactions?' I wonder does this mean just the transactions with the same machine_id, or the related transactions? 
 2. I am really confused about the defination of 'related transactions' and 'the sequence of bookings'. The first reason is people usually make multiple transactions at once (the same event_time at the same event_date). It's very hard to tell the sequence of bookings. For the transactions made at different time, it's very hard to tell they are related because we lack the time and location information for FLIGHT and CAR. I would very happy to work on the questions after settling down the details.
