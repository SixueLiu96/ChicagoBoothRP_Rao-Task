This folder contains two files:
- Data Task4.ipynb (The original results in jupyter notebook version for Task 1)
- Data Task4.pdf (PDF version of the results)

For the first question on identifying whether the funding source is from industry or not, after I check the original funding source informaton, I find the industry companies are always marked as 'XXX, Inc.' like 'Pespi, Inc.'. Therefore, I will mark the funding source is from industry if the ', Inc.' is in funding source description.  \
Please find the detailed answers of other questions in Data Task4.ipynb.
